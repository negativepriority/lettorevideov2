      <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
      <h3>
        Methods of processing
      </h3>
      <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent 
    unauthorised access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorised 
    destruction of the Data.<br>The Data processing is carried out using 
    computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organisational procedures 
    and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the
     Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of 
    persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application 
    (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or 
    external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail 
    carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) 
    appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated 
    list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
    
      <h3>
        Place
      </h3>
      <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any 
    other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.<br><br>
    Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve 
    transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To find 
    out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users 
    can check the section containing details about the processing of 
    Personal Data.</p>
    
      <h3>
        Retention time
      </h3>
      <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>
        Further Information for Users
          </h2>
    
    
      <h3>
      Legal basis of processing
    </h3>
    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
      <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
     with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
      <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
      <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public 
    interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
      <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
     basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the 
    provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
     a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
    
    
      <h3>
      Further information about retention time
    </h3>
    
    <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
    <p>Therefore:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of
     a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until such 
    contract has been fully performed.</li>
      <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate
     interests shall be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes.
     Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests 
    pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of  this document or 
    by contacting the Owner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period 
    whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as such 
    consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to 
    retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to fulfil a 
    legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
    Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. 
    Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to 
    rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
     expiration of the retention period.</p>
    
    
      <h3>The rights of Users based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
    <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
    
    <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following, to the extent permitted by law:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have 
    the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their 
    consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
      <li><strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have 
    the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is
     carried out on a legal basis other than consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn 
    if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding 
    certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data 
    undergoing processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
      <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have
     the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the 
    Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
    </li>
      <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>
      <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong>
     Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly 
    used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have 
    it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.</li>
      <li><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data 
    transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any 
    international organisation governed by public international law or set 
    up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security 
    measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br><br>
    If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking 
    the relevant sections of this document or enquire with the Owner using 
    the information provided in the contact section.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Details about the right to object to processing
    </h4>
    <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in 
    the exercise of an official authority vested in the Owner or for the 
    purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may 
    object to such processing by providing a ground related to their 
    particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
    <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be 
    processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that 
    processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any 
    justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing
     purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such 
    purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for 
    direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of 
    this document.</p>
    
    <h4>
      How to exercise these rights
    </h4>
    
    <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner 
    through  the contact details provided in this document. Such requests 
    are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as 
    possible and always within one month, providing Users with the 
    information required by law. Any rectification or erasure of Personal 
    Data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the Owner to 
    each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed 
    unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. At 
    the Users’ request, the Owner will inform them about those recipients.</p>
